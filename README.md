# Introduction:

#### The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, meaning it uses different Caesar ciphers with varying shifts based on a keyword. This code implements the Vigenere cipher in Python, providing a simple and user-friendly tool for encryption and decryption.

# Features:

#### Encrypts and decrypts text messages using a user-defined keyword.
#### Allows case-insensitive input for flexibility.
#### Handles non-alphabetic characters without modification.
#### Provides clear output messages, indicating which operation was performed.
#### Offers modular functions for potentially integrating into other projects.

# Instructions:

#### Clone the repository: Use git clone https://github.com/your_username/Vigenere-Cipher.git to download the code.
#### Run the script: Execute python3 vigenere_cipher.py in your terminal.
#### Follow the prompts: The script will ask for your text, keyword, and desired operation (encryption or decryption).
#### View the result: The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed in the console.

# Code Structure:

#### The code includes three main functions:

#### vigenere: This function performs the core encryption/decryption logic based on the Vigenere cipher principles.
#### encrypt: This function specifically calls vigenere with a positive direction for encryption.
#### decrypt: This function calls vigenere with a negative direction for decryption.
